## Predictive Machine Learning Modelings and Analysis

### [California Wildfire Risk Prediction and Application](/pdf/California_wildfire.html) 
The wildfire has always been a severe problem in California. Both the property damages and the physical and psychological damages done to people are enormous, and it also have long-term impacts on air quality, water resources, and ecosystems. To better control and reduce the risk of wildfires, the government has taken many preventive measures. However, given any preventive measure requires significant government funding, and the resources are limited, the government wants to be able to invent every dollar precisely to where it is needed to control spending. Therefore a more accurate means of predicting where wildfires will occur is needed.

### [Housing Price Prediction in Mecklenburg County](/pdf/HousingPrice.html) 
Zillow is an US real-estate marketplace company, it provides its users with house features information as well as estimations for homes that have undergone major changes. However, Zillow has realized that their housing market forecasts are not as accurate as they could be due to a lack of regional intelligence. In this project, we collected housing feature data, geographic data and census data, an then developed a machine learning model for Zillow to better predict the housing price in Mecklenburg County.

### [Crime Risk Prediction in Chicago](/pdf/HW3_Crime_Prediction.html) 
Crime has always been a key factor in cities that has a great impact on land values, zoning, resource allocation, etc. Analyzing crime-related factors and making predictions on crimes can help policymakers decide on regional policies, help police deploy resources more rationally, and also help people visualize the safety of a region more directly. Here, I developed a risk prediction model by borrowing experiences from places where crimes has been observed.

### [Bikeshare Prediction in Philadelphia](/pdf/Bikeshbare.html)
Indego, Philadelphiaâ€™s bike-share program, offers options to ride shared electric bicycles available at over 140 stations around the city, accessible all year round. It provides people a more convenient way to travel short distances. However, it would be a problem if people go to a station but find that there are no available bicycles or if people are ready to return bikes but find no space available, so it's important to carry out a re-balancing plan for the bikeshare company. In the project, I build a model to predict the peak space/time usage of bike-share so that the re-balancing program can be carried out effectively.

## Web Visualization

### [US Coastal Flood Risk](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/2ed153635dfc46a0a99c4bd4b62e6e92) 
Floods have brought great losses to US coastal areas and will cause even more damage in the future due to sea level rise. The severity of the flooding cannot be visualized by looking at the numbers alone. Here, I use data, map and other media sources to show you the severity of floods and how people deal with this problem.

### [Historic Constructions Detection](https://yuewendai.github.io/final-project/site//) 
This is a useful interactive map tool for exploring architectures in the city. For tourists and architects, this app will help them find the historic sites on map, read the introductions of the buildings, and add their own notes.

## Architecture and Urban Design

### [Hanyang Iron Plant Reconstruction Design](/pdf/hanyang.pdf)
Hanyang Steel Works is Chinaâ€™s heavy industry production base in the last century. However, for decades, its operation has also caused great damage to the surrounding environment. The natural ecology has been irreversibly damaged. This design aims to implant biological systems into the ruins of abandoned industrial plants through human intervention, so that nature can regain the right to speak. While achieving ecological sustainability, by organizing spaces where nature and architecture intersect each other, it promotes the re-harmonization of man and nature.

### [Young Migrant Collective Housing](/pdf/housing.pdf) 
This project is located in the Ziyang area of Wuhan, Hubei. On the north side of the project plot, there is one of the most important urban roads in Wuhan-Wuluo Road, which connects many important universities in Wuhan and serves as a bridge connecting Wuhan to the north and south rivers. Public transportation is developed on Wuluo Road. Considering that many colleges and universities on both sides of Wuluo Road can introduce a large number of young people to the land, the main population of residential design is young people.
